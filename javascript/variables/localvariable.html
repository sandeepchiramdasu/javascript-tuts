        <h1>Javascript Variable</h1>

        <p>A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. 
            There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable 
            and global variable.</p>
        
        <ol>

            <b>There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).</b>

            <li>Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.</li>
            <li>After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.</li>
            <li>JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.</li>
	
        </ol>

        <p>A JavaScript local variable is declared inside block or function. It is accessible within the 
            function or block only</p>

        <script>  
        
            var x = 10;  //local variable 
            var y = 20;  //local variable
            var z=x+y;  
            document.write(z);
 
        </script>
